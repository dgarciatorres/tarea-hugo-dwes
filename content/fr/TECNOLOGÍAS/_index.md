# DEVELOPPEMENT DE TERMES DE DIFFERENTES TECHNOLOGIES

**Babel**
C'est un outil qui nous permet de "traduire" n'importe quel fichier JS de dernière génération en JavaScript lisible par n'importe quel navigateur ou version node.js comprise.

---

**WebPack**
C'est un module packer ou bundler. Il est très concentré sur le développement d'applications axées sur une philosophie modulaire. Cette modularité est l'un de ses principaux avantages, mais aussi l'un de ses inconvénients puisqu'elle nous conditionne que tout ce que nous utilisons soit modularisable.
D'autres inconvénients sont que la configuration et le code source sont très complexes.
Les principaux avantages, outre la modularité déjà mentionnée, sont la maîtrise des processus et l'élimination des ressources inutiles.

**Prototype**
Framework Js orienté vers le développement simple d'applications web. Il fonctionne sous extensions et est devenu une référence au sein du monde AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) qui est une technique de développement d'applications web asynchrones, permettant d'interagir avec le serveur sans avoir besoin de recharger la page.

**Polyfill**
This is a code snippet that allows you to add modern functionality to old browsers that they do not have natively.

---

**PHP**
It is an open source backend language that is especially recommended for web development, as it can be embedded in HTMl. The opening and closing tags are:

```php
    <?php
        echo "Hello, this is a PHP script!";
    ?>
```
Its simple syntax is what has made it a very popular development language. One of the main CMS on the market, such as Wordpress, is based on this language.

Most of the work with php is focused on server-side script development.

---

**Frameworks de php**
They are specialized platforms for creating PHP applications. These frameworks have code libraries, thus reducing the amount of original code. This is the main advantage, since it provides us with a series of tools with which to develop web applications in a "simple" way.
There are many php frameworks, but the hostinguer platform has compiled a list of the 8 best:
1. Laravel
2. CodeIgniter
3. Symfony
4. Zend
5. Phalcon
6. CakePHP
7. Yii
8. FuelPHP

**DJango**
It is a high-level web framework written in Python and open source, which allows the development of complex websites quickly and easily. One of the main advantages of Django is its security and its maintainability, which has made it one of the most popular web development frameworks.
Django allows you to simplify tasks that are respectful, heavy and common when creating a website.
It is based on the Model View Controller (MVC) which consists of dividing an application into three large modules:
1. Model: in charge of managing the data
2. View: is the module that controls what the user sees
3. Controller: in charge of managing the communications between the model and the view.

**JSP**
JavaServer Pages: this is a technology that provides the developer with what is necessary to create a dynamic web based on HTML and XML. This technology uses the Java programming language and its operation is similar to PHP.

---

**Css**
Cascading Style Sheets is a style language used to write the presentation of an HTML or XML document.
Its evolution over the years has been important, even today there are those who consider it a programming language, although at first it was not considered as such.
Within a web project, the CSS architecture that allows us to define the general styles that the entire page is going to have is of special importance.
Over the years, technologies such as prepocessors (Sass, less, ...) emerged that simplified and improved css style sheets.

---

**Bootstrap** 
It is an open source framework used for responsive web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It makes available to the front-end developer a series of CSS and JS libraries with which to build the site.
We find many components such as modal windows, menus, tables, forms, buttons, ...
One of the characteristics that made it so famous was its Grid system based on 12 columns in which you arrange the content in an orderly manner. This made it much easier for the developers to distribute the content.
In the latest versions, it includes by default Flexbox by default, which is a very powerful CSS functionality that allows you to create responsive websites in a simpler way and with much less code.
Currently Bootstrap continues to enjoy a lot of fame among the development world and is going for its version 5.0.2.

**Vue**
It is a JavaScript library focused mainly on the development of web pages.
Its creator is Evan You, which continues to maintain it together with the great community it has.
Its great popularity has gained it thanks to its simplicity, but it allows creating all the views of a website, making them dynamic, connecting them to a server to access the database, ...
It is characterized by its great modularity, at first it offers you the basics and you can gradually incorporate functionalities. This allows it to be quite light compared to its other two competitors Angular and React.
1. Vue **80KB**
2. React **100KB**
3. Angular **+500KB**

**React**
What best defines it is "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces".
This bookstore was developed by Facebook.
It is not a framework, it is not even limited to the web. It is used with other libraries to render in certain environments.

Algunos ejemplos:
1. React + ReactNative = desarrollo de aplicaciones móviles
2. React + ReactDOM = desarrollo web
...

The ultimate goal of React is to **minimize errors** that developers can make when building user interfaces.

**Angular**
It is an open source framework developed by Google. Its purpose is to facilitate the creation and programming of SPA websites or single page websites.

This framework completely separates the frontend from the backend, avoids writing repetitive code and has a more organized system thanks to its Model-View-Controller pattern.

Its main language is Typescript that allows to unify the code, providing coherence and consistency which allows better maintenance, even by programmers outside the project itself.

**JavaScript**
It is a programming or scripting language that allows you to implement complex functions on web pages. It is one of the 3 standard web technologies, along with CSS and HTML.
This language gives dynamism and interactivity to our pages.
One of the advantages of this language is that it runs in the browser, it does not need a compiler.
We have a technology called AJAX that allows us to exchange information with the browser without having to reload the page, showing an important advance in web development.
It has become the most popular language, even creating a new version of Javascript that is Node JS, a version capable of being executed on the server itself.

---

**TypeScript**
It is a technology that emerged in 2012 from Microsoft and was born from the need to correct the problems generated by JavaScript in the maintenance and scalability of large projects.
Typescript is focused on a large-scale platform, for example Microsoft has used it to generate BING or Office 365, which are great applications.

The formal definition would be that Typescript is a Javascript superset, which generates a final result a javascript code

It encapsulates a series of Javascript functionality and adds stricter typing (javascript typing is quite free), adds the possibility of incorporating interfaces and adds reusable functions regardless of the type of data that we are going to get.

On the frontend it is used with react or vue in their latest versions.

**JQuery**
It is a multiplatform Javascript library, which allows us to simplify the way to interact with HTML documents, handle events, add interactions or develop animations among many other possibilities.

In recent years it was one of the most famous javasript libraries, but today it is losing weight among modern developers.

Its great advantage is the ease and simplicity of using the code that make this technology have a very short learning curve.
