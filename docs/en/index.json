	"content": "GENERAL CONCEPTS Definition of WEB development Term that defines the process of creating a website or an intranet.\nIn order to do this, client-side and server-side software technologies are used involving database processes with the use of a web browser to perform tasks or display information.\nTo develop an application or program\n You have to understand very well what you want to do You have to plan it You have to do that planning and test it   Web Application In software engineering, a web application is defined as those tools that users can use by accessing a web server through the Internet or an intranet through a browser. In other words, it is a program that is encoded in a language interpretable by web browsers in which the execution is entrusted to the browser.\nSource: Wikipedia\nAn information disclaimer\n Framework A work environment, or framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria to approach a particular type of problem that serves as a reference, to face and solve new problems of a similar nature.\nhttps://www.bestwebframeworks.com/\n Source: Wikipedia\nSee some technologies  What is the ip  Within the network level we have the IP protocol Its main function is to locate the network where the target computer is  What is the port  At the transport level we have the UDP and TCP protocols Its main function is to locate the application to which the communication or data is going to be destined It is done through a number known as the port name  ifconfig (ipconfig in windows) to know the ip that I have assigned\nping to send a greeting to a node in order to know if it is connected\nroute to know my routes and the IP of my nearest router (my gateway that routes)\ntracert to know the trace of routes or ip\u0026rsquo;s that a packet follows in a transmission\n Web server: A web server is an application that runs on a machine as a service and keeps listening on a certain port\nThe most popular:\n Apache HTTP Server Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services) NGINX Lighttpd Sun Java System Web Server  The curl command  Command to make resource requests without using a browser.

	"content": "ARCHITECTURE AND WEB TECHNOLOGY What is web architecture The ** web architecture ** is the hierarchy of information on a ** website **. Just as traditional architecture works on the structure of a construction, web architecture works on the structure of a web page and the categories that make it up for optimization for search engine positioning.\nMás info  The components of a web application 1. Web server A web server is a software (program) in charge of receiving a request over the network; In a tcp / ip type network that is the one we use on the internet, the request is received using the http protocol and responding to said request.\nResponding to this request involves checking permissions, executing a script, you may have to make requests for information to other servers and generate a response message using the http protocol as well. Very often the answer is an html page.\n2. Database Server A database server is a software (program) in charge of managing a database.\nGiven the importance of this section, confidentiality and possible bottleneck in an application, the database server is usually on a server specifically dedicated to that purpose.\n3. The code execution module on the server Before a request from the client, the server not only delivers a web page, before that it is very frequent that it executes code of which the client will never be aware.\nFor this we have to have a module installed on the server to execute that code. We will use PHP and later JavaScript on the server with NodeJS. It is the fundamental aspect for this module or subject\nThe architecture of the application A web application server can actually be made up of multiple physical servers.\n Each server can be in charge of executing a part of the application.\n 3-layer architecture  Data access layer: which will have to be in charge of storing the application information in a database and retrieving it when necessary. intermediate layer: where you must program the functionality of your application. client layer: which is where you will program everything related to the user interface, that is, the part visible of the application with which the user will interact.    *** How to be a BACKEND DEVELOPER? Route to LEARN WEB DEVELOPMENT in 2021 *** Carlos Azaustre - Learn JavaScript\nThe deployment architectures LAMP / WAMP architecture  LAMP LAMP is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Each of these components is open source and free to use, which has contributed to their popularity.  The lamp stack is probably the most common stack used for hosting websites and web applications, especially small to medium sized sites.\nWAMP The full form of WAMP is Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. As you can guess, the underlined operating system is Windows.  The only difference between WAMP and LAMP is the operating system behind these stacks. So everything mentioned above for LAMP is also done by WAMP, but only on Windows system.\nMEAN Architecture The medium stack is an open source JavaScript stack that you can use to build fast, robust, and easy-to-maintain modern production-ready web applications.\nThe middle stack is MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js.\nMongoDB is the NoSQL database and Express is the web framework running on the node, Angular is the client-side development platform, and Node.js is the runtime environment. Together, they can be used to create amazing web applications.\nJava EE architecture Java ™ Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) are widely used platforms for programming application servers in the Java programming language. You can use rule sessions to call Java SE or Java EE applications.\n More info\n Official documentation   What is a web application on wikipedia{% /button %}}\nWhat is a web development\nWhat is a URL vs difference with URI\n "

	"content": "DEVELOPMENT OF TERMS OF DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES Babel It is a tool that allows us to \u0026ldquo;translate\u0026rdquo; any latest generation JS file to JavaScript readable by any browser or node.js version understood.\n WebPack It is a module packer or bundler. He is very focused on the development of applications focused on a modular philosophy. This modularity is one of its main advantages, but also one of its drawbacks since it conditions us that everything we use is modularizable. Other disadvantages are that the configuration and source code are very complex. The main advantages, apart from the already mentioned modularity, are the control of the processes and the elimination of unnecessary resources.\n Prototype Js framework oriented to the simple development of web applications. It works under extensions and has become a benchmark within the AJAX world (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) which is a technique for developing asynchronous web applications, allowing interaction with the server without the need to reload the page.\nhttp://prototypejs.org/\n Polyfill This is a code snippet that allows you to add modern functionality to old browsers that they do not have natively.\n PHP It is an open source backend language that is especially recommended for web development, as it can be embedded in HTMl. The opening and closing tags are:\n\u0026lt;?php echo \u0026#34;Hello, this is a PHP script!\u0026#34;; ?\u0026gt;Its simple syntax is what has made it a very popular development language. One of the main CMS on the market, such as Wordpress, is based on this language.\nMost of the work with php is focused on server-side script development.\n Frameworks de php They are specialized platforms for creating PHP applications. These frameworks have code libraries, thus reducing the amount of original code. This is the main advantage, since it provides us with a series of tools with which to develop web applications in a \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; way. There are many php frameworks, but the hostinguer platform has compiled a list of the 8 best:\n Laravel CodeIgniter Symfony Zend Phalcon CakePHP Yii FuelPHP   DJango It is a high-level web framework written in Python and open source, which allows the development of complex websites quickly and easily. One of the main advantages of Django is its security and its maintainability, which has made it one of the most popular web development frameworks. Django allows you to simplify tasks that are respectful, heavy and common when creating a website. It is based on the Model View Controller (MVC) which consists of dividing an application into three large modules:\n Model: in charge of managing the data View: is the module that controls what the user sees Controller: in charge of managing the communications between the model and the view.   JSP JavaServer Pages: this is a technology that provides the developer with what is necessary to create a dynamic web based on HTML and XML. This technology uses the Java programming language and its operation is similar to PHP.\n Css Cascading Style Sheets is a style language used to write the presentation of an HTML or XML document. Its evolution over the years has been important, even today there are those who consider it a programming language, although at first it was not considered as such. Within a web project, the CSS architecture that allows us to define the general styles that the entire page is going to have is of special importance. Over the years, technologies such as prepocessors (Sass, less, \u0026hellip;) emerged that simplified and improved css style sheets.\n Bootstrap It is an open source framework used for responsive web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It makes available to the front-end developer a series of CSS and JS libraries with which to build the site. We find many components such as modal windows, menus, tables, forms, buttons, \u0026hellip; One of the characteristics that made it so famous was its Grid system based on 12 columns in which you arrange the content in an orderly manner. This made it much easier for the developers to distribute the content. In the latest versions, it includes by default Flexbox by default, which is a very powerful CSS functionality that allows you to create responsive websites in a simpler way and with much less code. Currently Bootstrap continues to enjoy a lot of fame among the development world and is going for its version 5.0.2.\n Vue It is a JavaScript library focused mainly on the development of web pages. Its creator is Evan You, which continues to maintain it together with the great community it has. Its great popularity has gained it thanks to its simplicity, but it allows creating all the views of a website, making them dynamic, connecting them to a server to access the database, \u0026hellip; It is characterized by its great modularity, at first it offers you the basics and you can gradually incorporate functionalities. This allows it to be quite light compared to its other two competitors Angular and React.\n Vue 80KB React 100KB Angular +500KB  (official documentation) https://vuejs.org/\n React What best defines it is \u0026ldquo;A JavaScript library for building user interfaces\u0026rdquo;. This bookstore was developed by Facebook. It is not a framework, it is not even limited to the web. It is used with other libraries to render in certain environments.\nAlgunos ejemplos:\n React + ReactNative = desarrollo de aplicaciones móviles React + ReactDOM = desarrollo web \u0026hellip;  The ultimate goal of React is to minimize errors that developers can make when building user interfaces.\n(official documentation) https://www.typescriptlang.org/\n Angular It is an open source framework developed by Google. Its purpose is to facilitate the creation and programming of SPA websites or single page websites.\nThis framework completely separates the frontend from the backend, avoids writing repetitive code and has a more organized system thanks to its Model-View-Controller pattern.\nIts main language is Typescript that allows to unify the code, providing coherence and consistency which allows better maintenance, even by programmers outside the project itself.\n(official documentation) https://www.typescriptlang.org/\n    Vídeo comparativa Vue vs React vs Angular\n   JavaScript It is a programming or scripting language that allows you to implement complex functions on web pages. It is one of the 3 standard web technologies, along with CSS and HTML. This language gives dynamism and interactivity to our pages. One of the advantages of this language is that it runs in the browser, it does not need a compiler. We have a technology called AJAX that allows us to exchange information with the browser without having to reload the page, showing an important advance in web development. It has become the most popular language, even creating a new version of Javascript that is Node JS, a version capable of being executed on the server itself.\n TypeScript It is a technology that emerged in 2012 from Microsoft and was born from the need to correct the problems generated by JavaScript in the maintenance and scalability of large projects. Typescript is focused on a large-scale platform, for example Microsoft has used it to generate BING or Office 365, which are great applications.\nThe formal definition would be that Typescript is a Javascript superset, which generates a final result a javascript code\nIt encapsulates a series of Javascript functionality and adds stricter typing (javascript typing is quite free), adds the possibility of incorporating interfaces and adds reusable functions regardless of the type of data that we are going to get.\nOn the frontend it is used with react or vue in their latest versions.\n(official documentation) https://www.typescriptlang.org/\n JQuery It is a multiplatform Javascript library, which allows us to simplify the way to interact with HTML documents, handle events, add interactions or develop animations among many other possibilities.\nIn recent years it was one of the most famous javasript libraries, but today it is losing weight among modern developers.\nIts great advantage is the ease and simplicity of using the code that make this technology have a very short learning curve.\n(official documentation) https://jquery.com/\n Gatsby\nGatsby is a framework based on modern technologies for creating fast, high-performance and accessible web applications.
